👋 Hi, I'm Marcos Yonamine, an Oracle Developer and Integration Specialist with over 6 years of experience in Middleware Systems Administration, Integration Development, Generative AI Engineering, Oracle Cloud Application Integration, Process Automation, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Consulting. I help technology teams and organizations automate complex integrations using OIC, SOA, and AI tools like CrewAI, minimizing bottlenecks and achieving up to 45% efficiency gains and 99.9% uptime.

## About Me

I specialize in facilitating efficient integrations and automations to support operational performance. My background includes restructuring WebCenter Portals with SAML/LDAP authentication, designing high-availability Kubernetes clusters, and integrating Generative AI via OCI/CrewAI for process optimization. As a certified instructor in OCI AI Foundations and Oracle Generative AI, I've trained over 100 professionals in BPM, SOA Suite, DevOps, and API management.

Currently, I focus on end-to-end OIC flows (App Driven, Scheduled, File Transfer) and AI integrations in hybrid environments using Docker, Ansible, Terraform, and observability tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK. My goal is to resolve integration challenges through AI-based solutions.

If you're tackling integration issues or need reliable cloud services, let's connect—share more about your needs!
